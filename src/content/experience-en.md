I studied media informatics in Wedel and started freelancing during my studies. Since then, I've been on the move as a freelancer. Among other things, I worked as a contractor for Peek & Cloppenburg, gaining experience collaborating with teams of various sizes.

I'm familiar with agile software development, such as Scrum and other methodologies, ensuring efficient work. As an experienced software developer, I'm well-versed in frontend and backend web technologies.

As a skilled software developer, I focus on web technologies in both frontend and backend areas.

In the frontend, I've acquired extensive knowledge in various frameworks like Angular, Vue.js, and React. My preferred approach when creating CSS is using Bootstrap in SCSS or TailwindCSS with PostCSS.

In the backend, I've worked with a multitude of frameworks, including Nest.js, Next.js, and Nuxt.js. Furthermore, I appreciate utilizing headless CMS systems like Strapi and Contentful, which I've had experience with.

Since diving into Shopify in 2015, I've gained comprehensive expertise in Shopify development. I prefer using Shopify for e-commerce projects, and I've successfully completed numerous projects. My expertise also includes developing Shopify backend apps for connecting to inventory management systems, shipping providers, automating tasks, or extending Shopify's functionality.

In my spare time, I work on developing my own web framework, heavily utilizing custom elements, web components, and JSX. Another current side project is developing a compatibility layer for Deno and Node.js, enabling their use in GJS, a lesser-known JavaScript runtime. This opens up the possibility for developers to use NPM and Deno modules in GJS.

These personal projects not only emphasize my passion for innovative technologies and continuous learning but also contribute to my professional development. They help me better understand the underlying technologies, thus avoiding mistakes from the get-go, which significantly contributes to my professional success.

Throughout my career, I've gained valuable experience in modularizing software projects, including converting applications into (micro-)services to ensure high scalability. This ability allows me to design projects more efficiently and future-proof while minimizing maintenance efforts and increasing flexibility in the development process.

Overall, I possess a broad spectrum of knowledge and experience in software development, enabling me to quickly adapt to new projects and technologies. I'm committed to continuously applying and expanding my skills to develop innovative solutions for complex challenges.
