title: About Me
---

I am a passionate software developer and proud father of two wonderful children. At the age of 36, I call Cuxhaven my home and have been fortunate enough to turn my hobby into my calling. In addition to programming, my current hobbies include cycling, survival, animes, retro gaming, and woodworking.
